### Project Overview
Wouldn't it be great if we could use a slideshow canvas as WSIWYG editor to rapidly design and ship UIs or start coding?

Airppt was built from the ground up to utilize the design elements of PPT presentations and reuse them anywhere. It is built with modularity, extensibility and flexibility in mind whilst abstracting a lot of the complexity. It's **not** a direct PPTX -> HTML converter; more like PPTX -> JSON -> HTML instead.

I'd also love for you to contribute. New to open source? I'm happy to walkthrough how to close your first issue. Pick a [time](https://goo.gl/forms/7NjFEYayLOuYdr2q1) that works best for you.

# airppt-parser

Powerpoint stores information in a series of complex XML mappings. Checkout the [OpenXML Spec](https://www.ecma-international.org/news/TC45_current_work/OpenXML%20White%20Paper.pdf) to get an idea of how [complex](http://officeopenxml.com/anatomyofOOXML-pptx.php) it really is.

The parser reads a Powerpoint file, takes in a slide number, and parses it to a standardized JSON object. The JSON object returned is defined as a `PowerPointElement`.

After utilizing the parser, we can pass it on to the [renderer module](https://github.com/airpptx/airppt-renderer#readme) to generate clean HTML/CSS, or you could use the object as you wish in your own application.

## Usage

I highly recommend looking at the [tests](https://github.com/airpptx/airppt-parser/tree/master/tests) folder. I continually keep that up-to-date. Be sure to get the latest package from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/airppt-parser).

```javascript
let { AirParser } = require("airppt-parser");

let pptParser = new AirParser("./sample.pptx");
waitForParsing();

async function waitForParsing() {
	//pass in the slide number and wait
	let result = await pptParser.ParsePowerPoint(1);

	//returns an array of Powerpoint Elements and some extra MetaData
	console.log(result);
}
```

## Powerpoint Element

Here is the interface definition of a `PowerpointElement`:

```javascript
export interface PowerpointElement {
	name: string;
	shapeType: ElementType;
	specialityType: SpecialityType;
	elementPosition: {
		x: number,
		y: number
	};
	elementOffsetPosition: {
		cx: number,
		cy: number
	};
	paragraph?: {
		text: string,
		textCharacterProperties: {
			fontAttributes: FontAttributes[],
			font: string,
			size: number,
			fillColor: string
		},
		paragraphProperties: {
			alignment: TextAlignment
		}
	};
	shape?: {
		border?: {
			thickness: number,
			color: string,
			type: BorderType,
			radius?: number
		},
		fill: {
			fillType: FillType,
			fillColor: string
		},
		opacity: number
	};
	fontStyle?: {
		font: string,
		fontSize: number,
		fontColor: string
	};
	links?: {
		Type: LinkType,
		Uri: string
	};
	raw: any;
}
```

There's are also a number of enums as well. See the entire [interface](https://github.com/rabi92/airppt-models/blob/master/pptelement.d.ts) here.
